# ProtoSpace

ProtoSpace is a laboratory protocol management web app focused on the education industry. 

It facilitates research learning by providing specific functionalities both to instructors and students. For instructors, ProtoSpace offers tools to manage protocols used in class, follow students' progress, and update the results into the university's systems. Students are guided through the protocols' steps and have a space where they can save their progress,  notes, and communicate with instructors. 
The whole project, from its ideation, and user research to this final working prototype was developed in 12 weeks as part of the integrated project course at Langara's Web and Mobile App Design and Development program.
